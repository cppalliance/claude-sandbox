== Overview

The Claude Sandbox repository is a testing and demonstration environment for the https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action[Claude Code GitHub Action]. This repository serves as a workspace for experimenting with Claude's automated code assistance capabilities within GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

== Purpose

This sandbox enables:

* Testing Claude Code integration with GitHub workflows
* Demonstrating Claude's ability to assist with software development tasks
* Exploring automated code review and implementation features
* Validating Claude Code Action configurations

== Repository Structure

The repository maintains a minimal structure focused on Claude Code integration:

----
.
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── claude.yml         # Claude Code GitHub Action workflow
├── CLAUDE.md                  # Coding standards and documentation guidelines
└── README.adoc                # This file
----

== Claude Code Integration

This repository uses the Claude Code GitHub Action to enable AI-assisted development. Claude can be triggered by mentioning `@claude` in:

* Issue comments
* Pull request comments
* Pull request review comments
* Issue descriptions

=== Workflow Configuration

The Claude Code workflow (`.github/workflows/claude.yml`) is configured with:

* Automatic triggering on `@claude` mentions
* Write permissions for contents, pull requests, and issues
* Read permissions for GitHub Actions (CI results)

== Development Guidelines

=== Code Style

This repository follows Boost C++ Libraries conventions as documented in `CLAUDE.md`:

* *Language*: C++11 unless otherwise specified
* *Naming*: snake_case (Boost C++ Libraries style)
* *Indentation*: 4 spaces, no tabs
* *Braces*: On their own line for classes and functions
* *Encapsulation*: Symbols in "detail" namespaces are never public

=== Project Structure

* *Public headers*: `include/` directory
* *Library implementation*: `src/` directory
* *Documentation*: Javadoc style following Boost conventions

=== Documentation Standards

Function and class documentation follows Boost Javadoc style:

* Brief descriptions start on first line after `\/**`
* Functions returning values: brief starts with "Return"
* Use `@param` for function parameters
* Use `@tparam` for template parameters (except variadic args and deduced types)
* Use `@return`, `@pre`, `@post`, `@throws`, `@note`, `@see` as appropriate
* Use `@code` / `@endcode` for examples

== Usage

To interact with Claude in this repository:

[source,text]
----
@claude <your request>
----

Example requests:

* "@claude Review this code for potential issues"
* "@claude Implement a function to calculate buffer size"
* "@claude Create unit tests for the new feature"
* "@claude Explain how this algorithm works"
